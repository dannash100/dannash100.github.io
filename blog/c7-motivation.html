            <h3 class="subheader">How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?

            </h3>
            <p class="answer">  
                These varying sources of happiness or reserves of meaning follow different temporalities. Purpose is the most sustainable and least volatile aspect of our happiness whereas pleasure is burnt through fast. Understanding pleasure, passion and purpose is understanding how and why we are driven and what being rewarded means to us. 

            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader"> What are your core values?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">Creativity and experimentation. Empathy and Family
            </p>

            <h3 class="subheader"> What do you stand for?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">I believe in having a non-judgemental and inclusive relationship towards how people might choose to live or inhabit the world. This means having patience with people that might challenge you and trying to find goodness in people that disappoint or hurt you. 
                I believe the most meaningful labour I have experienced has been building a sense of family. This has meant helping my family members and friends in really rough times of life despite its difficulty. I also believe its important to be continuously examining and developing your meaningful relationships, finding ways to communicate more openly and honestly and learning to form deep understandings about peoples lives and experiences. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader"> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">Resilience is brought about by understanding that failure is necessary on the path to success. I have experienced this during my introduction to JavaScript, periods of constant failure are followed by extremely rewarding days where it seems all the difficult concepts have suddenly become habit.
