    <h1>what's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h1>
     
     <p>An immersive high intensity course that focuses as much on personal development as teaching technical skills. I see it as a disciplined yet caring environment that encourages students to build strong inter-personal relationships and problem solving skills.</p>
    
     <h1>What are your impressions?</h1>

     <p>Seems like another world to me, I am beginning to understand the ‘mindset’ or attitudes and ideologies of this program and the behaviours favoured in careers in the sector. </p>

     <h1>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h1>

     <pre>
      It will challenge me but ultimately I think I will find it very rewarding. I am interested to see how I engage in group environments as I have little experience in this kind of space.
      I think it will favour inquisitive outlook and pay off to learn creatively and accept that failure is a part of this.

    <h1>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h1>

    <p>The video reinforced my expectations, I am coming to terms with the intensity of the process! </p>

    <h1>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h1>

    <pre>
      I am excited to learn to problem solve in pairs and larger groups and to get to know fellow students personally.
      Nervous to see if I can dig myself out of a difficult problem with grace and not by having a meltdown.</pre>
