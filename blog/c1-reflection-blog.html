      -What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
     
      An immersive high intensity course that focuses as much on personal development as teaching technical skills. I see it as a disciplined yet caring environment that encourages students to build strong inter-personal relationships and problem solving skills.
    

      -What are your impressions?

      Seems like another world to me, I am beginning to understand the ‘mindset’ or attitudes and ideologies of this program and the behaviours favoured in careers in the sector. 
    

      -How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

      It will challenge me but ultimately I think I will find it very rewarding. I am interested to see how I engage in group environments as I have little experience in this kind of space.
      I think it will favour inquisitive outlook and pay off to learn creatively and accept that failure is a part of this.


      -Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

      The video reinforced my expectations, I am coming to terms with the intensity of the process! 


      -Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

      I am excited to learn to problem solve in pairs and larger groups and to get to know fellow students personally.
      Nervous to see if I can dig myself out of a difficult problem with grace and not by having a meltdown.
