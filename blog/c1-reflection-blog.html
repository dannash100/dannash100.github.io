            <h3 class="subheader">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
            <p class="answer">An immersive high intensity course that focuses as much on personal development as teaching technical skills. I see it as a disciplined yet caring environment that encourages students to build strong inter-personal relationships and problem solving skills.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What are your impressions?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Seems like another world to me, I am beginning to understand the ‘mindset’ or attitudes and ideologies of this program and the behaviours favoured in careers in the sector..</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
            <p class="answer">It will challenge me but ultimately I think I will find it very rewarding. I am interested to see how I engage in group environments as I have little experience in this kind of space. I think it will favour inquisitive outlook and pay off to learn creatively and accept that failure is a part of this.</p>
           <h3 class="subheader">Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
           <p class="answer">The video reinforced my expectations, I am coming to terms with the intensity of the process!</p>
           <h3 class="subheader">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
           <p class="answer">I am excited to learn to problem solve in pairs and larger groups and to get to know fellow students personally. Nervous to see if I can dig myself out of a difficult problem with grace and not by having a meltdown.</p>
