    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An immersive high intensity course that focuses as much on personal development as teaching technical skills. I see it as a disciplined yet caring environment that encourages students to build strong inter-personal relationships and problem solving skills.</li>
    </ul> 
     <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Seems like another world to me, I am beginning to understand the ‘mindset’ or attitudes and ideologies of this program and the behaviours favoured in careers in the sector.</li> 
     </ul>
     <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>It will challenge me but ultimately I think I will find it very rewarding. I am interested to see how I engage in group environments as I have little experience in this kind of space.</li>
       <li>I think it will favour inquisitive outlook and pay off to learn creatively and accept that failure is a part of this.</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The video reinforced my expectations, I am coming to terms with the intensity of the process!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am excited to learn to problem solve in pairs and larger groups and to get to know fellow students personally.</li>
      <li>Nervous to see if I can dig myself out of a difficult problem with grace and not by having a meltdown.</li>
    </ul>
