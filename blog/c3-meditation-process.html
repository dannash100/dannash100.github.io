            <h3 class="subheader">What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer"> I have always been envious of people who meditated regularly and have always assumed that there is a really steep learning curve. I have never had much success with it myself, assuming that I would forever be bad at it or that my brain was too frantic to ever grasp it.  
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
            <p class="answer">That drifting attention in meditation is normal and not to be considered a failure, the process of training the brain to respond to these drifts strengthens meta-concentration and makes for deeper meditation.  
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Meditation posture that makes the body feel both alert and relaxed. Tongue held against the upper palate and lips slightly apart was huge for me, I think I carry a lot of tension in my jaw and this meant I couldn't clench my teeth, doing these two things alone helps me relax and I had some success meditate undercover in busy areas. The section about being aware of your attitude towards yourself stuck out to me, I really love the concept of the “grandmother mind”. It seems obvious to me now, but failure has no place in meditation, this lack of pressure really helped my immersion in the process.
