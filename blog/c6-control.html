            <h3 class="subheader">When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer"> 
                Getting flustered and burying myself in the minute details of a problem where a lateral broad view is often better suited. I found that rather than adjusting and tinkering something endlessly it was better to take a break, copy the section of code I was struggling with into another window and start from fresh. I think that my problems stem from being so fresh to the subtleties of the coding, it seems like it takes a knack that can only be learnt from failing and repeating.

            <p class="answer">Building the sections of code in Minesweeper I came across a major problem where I wrote a function for generating the board, I still can’t wrap my head around it, but it only worked on a 3x3 board. I got so flustered and panicky, like I wasn’t smart enough for this course, before realising something mentioned earlier that it is best to focus on process over product. I will come back to this code and hopefully have an insane burst of serotonin when I do work it out. I have always loved puzzles and this aspect of writing code is proving to be incredibly satisfying.

            </h3>
            <p class="answer">I like how this process was described as a sacred pause, like stepping out of time and watching your triggers find there way into your emotions. I have felt all over the place this week for the first time since starting phase-0, I have been getting really frustrated with myself for my rapidly shifting attention span and noisy brain. This process made me realise that over the coming weeks I need to try find a way to lower my resistance towards my naturally scattered state of thinking and make it work for me- rather than letting this trigger a feeling of restlessness and disappointment in myself.
