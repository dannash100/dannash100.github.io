            <h3 class="subheader">Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem or solved a problem in an elegant way.  </h3>
            <p class="answer">While working through the Javascript exercises in Sprint 4 I had a couple moments where I couldn’t get the code to function in the way that I wanted it to. I remember reading earlier on that often seemingly large problems can be due to a single missing piece of syntax. After rewriting the code and trying some new angles without success, I discovered the “Problems” tabs in Visual Studio and followed its prompts to discover that I had only missed a closing curly braces at the end of my function. This was my first experience of being truly blocked so far in the course, at first I felt guilty that I had lost so much time without learning anything new, but later realised that in rewriting my code and staring at it for so long, I had actually committed some of the more complicated commands to memory that I was struggling with. 
            </p>
            <p class="answer">I think I am yet to have solved a problem in an elegant way, I can visualise more compact and simple code that repeats less but have not had the confidence to implement it. I still feel like I am getting used to the basics but this is a goal for the next sprint. </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Reflect on how confident you feel using problem solving techniques and process.</h3>
            <p class="answer">Experimentation alongside open bookmarks and personal notes has been my primary technique for problem solving so far. I also have learnt to use the Problem tab and Run Code function in Visual Studio to identify problems. I anticipate Pseudocode will become very useful as the complexity ramps up and I look forward to giving this a go soon. I feel a bit uncertain of asking others for help at this stage but it does comfort me knowing I can if I get really stuck.  I have found that if time permits sleeping is a great problem solving tool, I always wake up with solutions as all the previous days work has settled and taken form in my head. </p>
