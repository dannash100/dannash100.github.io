            <h3 class="subheader">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer"> 
                Mindfulness includes meditations on self awareness, discovering a non-judgement relationship with your emotions. Aiming towards an objective experience of your inner thoughts. Mindfulness also brings this idea of non-judgemental experience into the exterior world, seeing the world though a un-distorted lens.

            <h3 class="subheader">Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">Following the Body Scan exercise was a really powerful experience. I experience anxiety in a way that is referred to in physiologically as dissociation, this means a sense of detachment from the body as a kind of disavowal of ones selfhood. I found Body Scan so effective as it grounded me in my body, analysed what parts of my body make me uncomfortable and hold stress and emotion, and make adjustments to them. Once again I found my jaw to be a major area of stress, as well as my shoulders and back from terrible posture.

           <h3 class="subheader">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
           <p class="answer">I found it interesting to think about the statement of “I am angry”, “I am sad” etc, this common phrase truly does express a kind of 1-to-1 relationship between self and emotion. In my experience it only takes around ten minutes of sitting with a particular emotion to have a more healthy response, in this way emotions really do have less of a hold on me as they initially appear in the throws of anger or sadness. I think the way you talk to yourself about emotions is important, maybe a better way to frame it is something more like an internal investigation “I am experiencing a feeling of anger, why? Is it justified? Is it maybe to do with insecurity or something simple like lack of sleep, hunger etc.”</p>
