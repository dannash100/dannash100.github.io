            <h3 class="subheader">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
            <p class="answer">That their is an implicit relationship with intra-personal or self-awareness and the awareness of others. I believe this connection is built as one learns to analyse their thoughts objectively, making an other out of yourself- or seeing yourself with fresh eyes. 
               I found it interesting that emotional intelligence is performed beginning in the body, in that emotions have a bodily correlate that is intuited before the brain is conscious of it. Mindfulness describes thoughts in tactile ways, it teaches you to identify your emotions, to reduce their imposing effects by naming and giving them form in your imagination.

            <h3 class="subheader">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness</h3>
            <p class="answer">It reminded me how out of practice I am with meditation, I was quite distracted but it made me aware that I have a possibly unhealthy sense of urgency at the moment, a fear that I have to use my time wisely. I think that this feeling is a product of learning about time accountability, I can see why finding a balance between reflection and work is important. I will use the Headspace app to develop my skills in mindfullness over the coming weeks.</p>
