            <h3 class="subheader">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer">JavaScript is a web-based programming language that allows for interactivity and dynamic content, It is more reflexive and complex than HTML and CSS. An example of Javascript in action is the suggested search/auto correct on google. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teethâ€™. </h3>
            <p class="answer">Program flow - A point where code may follow multiple alternative courses like a junction in a road, these include the conditional statements if and else along with switch statement. This process could be explained like deciding which path to take to a destination, if it is raining the individual walks under cover and if it is not they chose to walk the scenic route through the park. 
            </p>
            <P class="answer">Loops - Repeat a structure until the condition statement is met. This condition is often a pre-defined set number of iterations. An analogy for loops could be the process of washing rice, the rice is washed in cold water and then the water is checked to see if it is clear of starch, if it is not repeat washing process untill it is.
            <h3 class="subheader">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <p class="answer">To access data in an array use indexes. Written in brackets indexes specify the position of the entry in the array that the user wishes to access. Indexes use numerical values starting at 0 for the first entry in the array. 
            </p>
            <p class="answer">To access date in an object use the command objectName. followed by name of the property the user wishes to access, if it has a space in its name use [propertyName]. To access nested objects chain together dot and bracket notations to get to the desired property. </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
            <p class="answer">A wireframe is a simplistic sketch-like design of a page that includes mock-ups of various screen formats. This makes it easier to visualise as we implement our design into HTML.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
            <p class="answer">Functions are reusable groups of code that are executed when called upon (invoked). They receive values and return values. In this way they can be thought of as little machines that process incoming material and output a product. </p>
