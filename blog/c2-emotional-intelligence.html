      <h1 class="title">Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2 class="subheader">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>That their is an implicit relationship with intra-personal or self-awareness and the awareness of others. I beleive this connection is built as one learns to analyse their thoughts objectivly, making an other out of yourself- or seeing yourself with fresh eyes. </li>
        <li>I found it interesting that emotional inteligence is performed begening in the body, in that emotions have a bodily correlate that is intuited before the brain is concious of it</li>
        <li>Mindfullness describes thoughts in tactile ways, it teaches you to identify your emotions, to reduce their imposing effects by naming and giving them form in your imagination</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="subheader">How did you find the two minutes of mindfullness</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It reminded me how out of practice I am with meditation, I was quite distracted but it made me aware that I have a possibly unhealthy sense of urgency at the moment, a fear that I have to use my time wisely</li>
        <li>I think that this feeling is a product of learning about time accountibility, I can see why finding a balence between reflection and work is important</li>
        <li>I will use the Headspace app to develop my skills in mindfullness over the coming weeks</li>
      </ul>
