            <h3 class="subheader">What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h3>
            <p class="answer">A responsive site is a website with a layout that adapts to the variety of screen sizes that it is viewed on. This also accounts for things like touch screens which lack the possibility of hover over effects. Responsiveness is important because of the prevalence of mobile devices and larger touch screen surfaces, the designer of the website cannot control how the website is viewed, so must account for a variety of screen sizes and browsers. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What mobile first design is, and why its important.</h3>
            <p class="answer">Mobile first design starts with the smallest screen and the CSS is written in such a way that the website adapts to larger screens by changing format to include more information, links, images etc.  This reversal of the traditional desktop first design is important because of the increasing ubiquity of mobile device, it deals with the hardest most restricted format first so there is more freedom with larger screen sizes.  </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h3>
            <p class="answer">A framework expands upon the capability of HTML and CSS, by introducing features and concepts that make for ease of design and improved cross-format functionality. Frameworks donâ€™t actually include anything that cannot be manually coded into HTML and CSS, they are just popular basis for building websites. Downsides of frameworks include extra baggage in the code that is unused and not ideal for beginners as it essentially skips a step in the understanding of the code. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
            <p class="answer">A wireframe is a simplistic sketch-like design of a page that includes mock-ups of various screen formats. This makes it easier to visualise as we implement our design into HTML.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult.</h3>
            <p class="answer">I changed my design dramatically from my wireframe, this was primarily for aesthetic reasons, I opted for a simpler design and readability over an intricate layered design. The hardest part of implementing my website was spelling mistakes in my div-classes and CSS, I felt the process was really unstable and confusing before I noticed these mistakes. I also found it confusing the way that content organises itself on the page when grouping multiple elements within a div class. I think that this is probably due to not fully understanding some of the CSS options available to me.   </p>
