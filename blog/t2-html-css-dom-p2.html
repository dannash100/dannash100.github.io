      <h2 class="subheader">What is grid based design?</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Utilizing CSS to divide the width of the page into 12 columns.
          <li>The design is first divided into the row div class that takes up 100% of the page width and then further into specific amounts of columns</li>
          <li>Using flex and float commands the contents of a website can be organized to follow the design in mind</li>
          <li>This feature is included in the Bootstrap framework</li>
      </ul>
          <h2 class="subheader">What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, varying screen sizes and different browsers available, the HTML should be written in such a way that it is responsive to these variations</li>
              <li>This means that the website won't deform in an unwanted way as the size of the window is changed</li>
              <li>This allows for a streamlined experience when using the website across multiple platforms</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="subheader">What is semantic structure?</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>How the page is divided up and then referenced in CSS</li>
              <li>This includes div tags, headings h1-6, sections, footers, asides, navigation links nav, articles and header </li>
              <li>There is a large range of semantic options for things like images, inline text and table contents</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="subheader">Any other points you found interesting</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>While reading through the HTML and CSS best practice guide I found that using div classes uneccisarily is not reccomended and instead semantics like header, article, footer etc should be used when appropriate</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
