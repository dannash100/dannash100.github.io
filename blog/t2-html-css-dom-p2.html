            <h3 class="subheader">What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Utilising CSS to divide the width of the page into 12 columns. The design is first divided into the row div class that takes up 100% of the page width and then further into specific amounts of columns. Using flex and float commands the contents of a website can be organized to follow the design in mind. This feature is included in the Bootstrap framework
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, varying screen sizes and different browsers available, the HTML should be written in such a way that it is responsive to these variations. This means that the website won't deform in an unwanted way as the size of the window is changed.This allows for a streamlined experience when using the website across multiple platforms. </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p class="answer">How the page is divided up and then referenced in CSS. This includes div tags, headings h1-6, sections, footers, asides, navigation links nav, articles and header. There is a large range of semantic options for things like images, inline text and table contents.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Any other points you found interesting?</h3>
            <p class="answer">hile reading through the HTML and CSS best practice guide I found that using div classes unnecessarily is not recommended and instead semantics like header, article, footer etc should be used when appropriate.</p>
