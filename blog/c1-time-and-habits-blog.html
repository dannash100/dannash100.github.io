    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Headspace App</li>
       <li>Pomodoro Technique</li>
       <li>Thinking of confidence as displayed ability</li>

       <li>Walking</li>
       <li>Creating/Changing habits</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Meditation can increase empathy responses, make people images of people more compassionate and understanding. </li> 
      <li>Meditation can lessen the effects of fear and active reasoning parts to respond instead, this is interesting to me as I experience anxiety physiologically (shakes, sweats etc) which has been described to me as malfunctioning adrenaline/noradrenaline behaviour. Anxiety is often experienced as a kind of omnipresent sense of fear even in safe environments, so I think developing a habit of meditation would greatly improve my quality of life.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2> what worked for you?</h2>
    <ul> 
      <li>I used my break time to practise a creative pursuit, creating music in logic and creative writing. This way I can build an inventory of small creative work that I can assemble into something larger at a later date. I feel like this is a good way to use my time in between tasks, reminding myself that I can practice art and writing even under heavy workloads.</li> 
      </ul>

    <h2>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I have always wanted to experiment with meditation further and will try to find a class in Wellington in the weekend, I am interested in exploring meditation practises outside of mindfulness, to learn older traditions and practises that act as the framework that mindfulness was built from.</li>
        <li>Acknowledging complexity, consider that not everyday is going to be as productive as the last, allow for natural variations of mood and not punish myself or self-produce a sense of urgency so large it turns into panic.</li>
      </ul>
