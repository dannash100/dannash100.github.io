            <h3 class="subheader">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
            <p class="answer"> Headspace App, Pomodoro Technique, Thinking of confidence as displayed ability, Exercise, Walking, Creating/Changing habits.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What did you find interesting?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Meditation can increase empathy responses, make people images of people more compassionate and understanding. Meditation can lessen the effects of fear and active reasoning parts to respond instead, this is interesting to me as I experience anxiety physiologically (shakes, sweats etc) which has been described to me as malfunctioning adrenaline/noradrenaline behaviour. Anxiety is often experienced as a kind of omnipresent sense of fear even in safe environments, so I think developing a habit of meditation would greatly improve my quality of life.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">What worked for you?</h3>
            <p class="answer">I used my break time to practise a creative pursuit, creating music in logic and creative writing. This way I can build an inventory of small creative work that I can assemble into something larger at a later date. I feel like this is a good way to use my time in between tasks, reminding myself that I can practice art and writing even under heavy workloads.</p>
            <h3 class="subheader">Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
            <p class="answer"> have always wanted to experiment with meditation further and will try to find a class in Wellington in the weekend, I am interested in exploring meditation practises outside of mindfulness, to learn older traditions and practises that act as the framework that mindfulness was built from. Acknowledging complexity, consider that not everyday is going to be as productive as the last, allow for natural variations of mood and not punish myself or self-produce a sense of urgency so large it turns into panic.</p>
