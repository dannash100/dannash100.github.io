    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <h2>18 April 2018</h2>
    
    <h3> which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h3>
    <p>
        Headspace App, Pomodoro Technique, Thinking of Confidence as displayed ability, Exercise, Walking, Creating/Changing habits.
    </p>
    <h3> what did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>
        Meditation can increase empathy responses, make people images of people more compassionate and understanding. 
    </p>
    <p>Meditation can lessen the effects of fear and active reasoning parts to respond instead, this is interesting to me as I experience anxiety physiologically (shakes, sweats etc) which has been described to me as malfunctioning adrenaline/noradrenaline behaviour. Anxiety is often experienced as a kind of omnipresent sense of fear even in safe environments, so I think developing a habit of meditation would greatly improve my quality of life. </p>
    <h3> what worked for you?</h3>
    <p>I used my break time to practise a creative pursuit, creating music in logic and creative writing. This way I can build an inventory of small creative work that I can assemble into something larger at a later date. I feel like this is a good way to use my time in between tasks, reminding myself that I can practice art and writing even under heavy workloads. </p>
    <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>I have always wanted to experiment with meditation further and will try to find a class in Wellington in the weekend, I am interested in exploring meditation practises outside of mindfulness, to learn older traditions and practises that act as the framework that mindfulness was built from.</p>
    <p>Acknowledging complexity, consider that not everyday is going to be as productive as the last, allow for natural variations of mood and not punish myself or self-produce a sense of urgency so large it turns into panic. </p>
