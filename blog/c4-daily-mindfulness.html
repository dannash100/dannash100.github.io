            <h3 class="subheader">What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?
            </h3>
            <p class="answer"> 
                I learnt that it is important to not fear silences in conversations, to allow people space to form thoughts. I noticed that this ultimately made conversation more natural and free-flowing. I found this exercise really useful as I struggle with communication and can come across unintentionally disinterested due to nervous movements and interruptions.

            <h3 class="subheader">Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Allowing a small part of my attention to analyse my emotional response to the speaker was really useful- this helped me to not speak impulsively and understand why I might become uncomfortable during conversation. I also think that repeating what the speaker says back to them is a great way to practice comprehension and express sincere interest in a conversation.
